# Resource Edit Approval Feature - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Feature Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive resource edit approval workflow to the uninest application. Students can now edit their approved resources, with changes requiring coordinator approval while the original version remains visible.

## ✨ What's New

### For Students

#### 1. Edit Resources
- **Edit Approved Resources**: When you edit an approved resource, a new version is created for approval
- **Current Version Stays Live**: The original approved version remains visible to everyone until the new version is approved
- **Edit Pending Resources**: Resources that haven't been approved yet can be edited directly

#### 2. Delete Resources
- Delete resources that are still pending approval
- Delete rejected resources
- Delete pending edit requests

#### 3. Dashboard Visibility
Your dashboard now shows two clear sections:
- **Pending New Uploads**: Resources you've uploaded waiting for approval
- **Pending Edit Approvals**: Edit requests waiting for coordinator review

### For Subject Coordinators

#### 1. Organized Approval System
Two separate tabs for better organization:
- **New Uploads Tab**: Review first-time submissions
- **Edit Approvals Tab**: Review edit requests with version numbers

#### 2. Sidebar Navigation
Resource Approvals menu is now expandable with sub-items:
```
Resource Approvals
  ├─ New Uploads
  └─ Edit Approvals
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Student Uploads New Resource
1. Student uploads a resource → Status: **Pending**
2. Appears in coordinator's "New Uploads" tab
3. Coordinator approves → Status: **Approved** (visible to all)
4. OR Coordinator rejects → Status: **Rejected** (student can edit or delete)

### Scenario 2: Student Edits Approved Resource
1. Student clicks "Edit" on their approved resource
2. Makes changes and submits
3. System creates a **new version** (v2) with Status: **Pending Edit**
4. **Original version (v1) remains visible** to everyone
5. New version appears in coordinator's "Edit Approvals" tab
6. Coordinator approves:
   - Old version becomes "Replaced" and hidden
   - New version becomes "Approved" and visible
7. Everyone now sees the updated version

### Scenario 3: Student Edits Pending Resource
1. Student clicks "Edit" on a pending/rejected resource
2. Makes changes and submits
3. Same resource is updated (no new version)
4. Remains in "New Uploads" tab

## 🗄️ Database Changes

New fields added to the `resources` table:
- `parent_resource_id` - Links edited versions to originals
- `version` - Tracks version number
- `edit_type` - Distinguishes between 'new' uploads and 'edits'
- Extended `status` enum to include 'pending_edit' and 'replaced'

### Migration for Existing Databases
A migration script is provided at:
```
src/main/resources/db/migration/add_resource_versioning.sql
```

Run this script on your database before deploying the updated application.

## 🎨 UI Components

### New Pages
1. **Edit Resource Page** (`/student/resources/edit`)
   - Pre-filled form with current resource details
   - Option to keep or replace file/link
   - Info alert explaining approval process for approved resources

### Updated Pages
1. **Student Dashboard** (`/student/dashboard`)
   - New sections for pending requests
   - Tables showing detailed information
   - Quick view actions

2. **Resource Detail** (`/student/resources/{id}`)
   - Edit button (for resource owner)
   - Delete button (for pending/rejected resources)
   - Status badges

3. **Coordinator Approvals** (`/subject-coordinator/resource-approvals`)
   - Tab navigation (New Uploads / Edit Approvals)
   - Version indicators
   - Organized tables

## 📋 Status Reference

| Status | Meaning | Visible To |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **pending** | New upload awaiting approval | Owner only |
| **approved** | Approved and live | Everyone |
| **rejected** | Rejected by coordinator | Owner only |
| **pending_edit** | Edit awaiting approval | Owner only |
| **replaced** | Old version replaced by approved edit | System only (hidden) |

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Backup your database** (important!)

2. **Apply database migration**:
   ```sql
   source src/main/resources/db/migration/add_resource_versioning.sql
   ```

3. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. **Deploy** the WAR file to your Tomcat server

5. **Verify** the deployment by checking:
   - Student can access edit functionality
   - Coordinator sees two tabs in Resource Approvals
   - Dashboard shows pending requests

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything works:

- [ ] Upload a new resource as a student
- [ ] Verify it appears in coordinator's "New Uploads" tab
- [ ] Approve the resource
- [ ] Verify it's visible to other students
- [ ] Edit the approved resource
- [ ] Verify old version is still visible
- [ ] Verify edit appears in "Edit Approvals" tab
- [ ] Approve the edit
- [ ] Verify new version replaced old version
- [ ] Edit a pending resource
- [ ] Verify it updates in place
- [ ] Delete a pending resource
- [ ] Check student dashboard shows pending requests correctly
- [ ] Test rejection workflow
- [ ] Verify all status badges are correct

- **Implementation Guide**: `RESOURCE_EDIT_APPROVAL_GUIDE.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- **Migration Script**: `src/main/resources/db/migration/add_resource_versioning.sql`
- **Original Schema**: `src/main/resources/db/migration/db.sql`

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

✅ **Authorization**: Students can only edit/delete their own resources
✅ **Validation**: Proper status checks before allowing operations
✅ **Transactions**: Atomic operations for edit approvals
✅ **File Safety**: Files stored outside webapp directory
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Version Preservation**: Old versions remain visible during edit review to ensure continuous access
2. **Separate Workflows**: New uploads and edits are clearly separated for coordinator efficiency
3. **In-Place Editing**: Pending/rejected resources can be edited directly without creating versions
4. **Smart Status**: Five distinct statuses track the complete lifecycle
5. **UI Consistency**: All components follow existing design patterns

## ✅ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
- Students can edit their resources
- Old versions remain visible during review
- Coordinators can easily distinguish between new uploads and edits
- Dashboard clearly shows all pending requests
- All workflows complete without errors
- UI is consistent and user-friendly
