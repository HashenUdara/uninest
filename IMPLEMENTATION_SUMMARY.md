# Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds a complete organization management system to the uninest application with the following capabilities:

### 1. Organization Management System
- Moderators can create organizations with title and description
- Organizations require admin approval before becoming active
- Admins can approve or reject organization requests
- Organization IDs are auto-generated and shared with students

### 2. Enhanced Student Signup
- Students must select their academic year (1-4)
- Students must select their university from 15 Sri Lankan universities
- Fields dynamically show/hide based on selected role
- All validations performed server-side

### 3. Organization Joining for Students
- Students enter organization ID after signup
- System validates organization exists and is approved
- Students cannot access dashboard until joined to an organization

### 4. Access Control Workflow

#### Moderator Workflow:
```
Signup → Create Organization → Pending Approval → Admin Approves → Dashboard Access
         (blocks here until approved)
```

#### Student Workflow:
```
Signup (with year & university) → Enter Org ID → Join Organization → Dashboard Access
                                   (blocks here until joined)
```

#### Admin Workflow:
```
Login → View Organizations → Approve/Reject → Organizations Activated
```

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: organizations
- `id` - Auto-generated organization ID
- `title` - Organization name
- `description` - Organization description
- `moderator_id` - Foreign key to user
- `status` - pending/approved/rejected
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

### Updated Table: users
- `organization_id` - Foreign key to organization (nullable)
- `academic_year` - Student's year (1-4, nullable)
- `university` - Student's university name (nullable)

## Key Features

### Security

✅ Cascade deletes configured appropriately
✅ NULL values handled correctly
✅ Enum types for status management

## URLs Added

- `/moderator/create-organization` - Organization creation
- `/moderator/organization-pending` - Pending approval status
- `/student/join-organization` - Join organization
- `/admin/organizations` - Manage organizations

## Build Status

✅ Maven compile: SUCCESS
✅ Maven package: SUCCESS (WAR file created)
✅ All Java files: 29 total
✅ All JSP files: 17 total
✅ Zero compilation errors

## Next Steps for User

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Run the updated `db/migration/db.sql` script
   - Or apply the migration SQL from `DATABASE_CHANGES.md`

2. **Testing:**
   - Test moderator signup → org creation → pending → admin approval → dashboard
   - Test student signup → org joining → dashboard
   - Test admin org approval functionality

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat
   - Verify database connection
   - Test all workflows end-to-end

## Notes

- Implementation follows minimal change principle
- Existing functionality preserved
- Code style matches existing patterns
- All changes are backward compatible (new fields are nullable)
- Documentation provided for easy understanding
