# Student and Moderator Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing students and moderators in the UniNest admin dashboard.

## Key Features

### Students Management
- **List Students**: View all students in a paginated, sortable table at `/admin/students`
- **Add Student**: Create new student accounts with email, password, academic year, university, and community assignment at `/admin/students/add`
- **Edit Student**: Update student information at `/admin/students/edit?id={id}`
- **Delete Student**: Remove student accounts at `/admin/students/delete` (POST)
- **Search Students**: Search students by email or university using the search bar

### Moderators Management
- **List Moderators**: View all moderators in a paginated, sortable table at `/admin/moderators`
- **Add Moderator**: Create new moderator accounts with email, password, university, and community assignment at `/admin/moderators/add`
- **Edit Moderator**: Update moderator information at `/admin/moderators/edit?id={id}`
- **Delete Moderator**: Remove moderator accounts at `/admin/moderators/delete` (POST)
- **Search Moderators**: Search moderators by email or university using the search bar

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The implementation uses the existing `users` table with role-based filtering:
- Students have `role_id` corresponding to the 'student' role
- Moderators have `role_id` corresponding to the 'moderator' role
- Users can be optionally assigned to communities via `community_id`
- Students have additional fields: `academic_year` (1-4) and `university`

### Backend Components

#### DAO Layer Extensions (`UserDAO.java`)
New methods added to support user management:
- `findByRole(String roleName)`: Get all users with a specific role
- `searchUsers(String roleName, String searchTerm)`: Search users by email or university
- `findById(int id)`: Get a single user by ID
- `update(User user)`: Update user information
- `deleteUser(int userId)`: Delete a user

#### Servlets
**Students Management:**
- `StudentsServlet`: Lists all students with search support
- `AddStudentServlet`: Handles student creation
- `EditStudentServlet`: Handles student updates
- `DeleteStudentServlet`: Handles student deletion

**Moderators Management:**
- `ModeratorsServlet`: Lists all moderators with search support
- `AddModeratorServlet`: Handles moderator creation
- `EditModeratorServlet`: Handles moderator updates
- `DeleteModeratorServlet`: Handles moderator deletion

### Frontend Components

#### JSP Views
**Students:**
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/students.jsp`: Main listing page with search and table
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/add-student.jsp`: Student creation form
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/edit-student.jsp`: Student edit form

**Moderators:**
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/moderators.jsp`: Main listing page with search and table
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/add-moderator.jsp`: Moderator creation form
- `/WEB-INF/views/admin/edit-moderator.jsp`: Moderator edit form

#### UI Components
- Uses the reusable `admin-dashboard` layout tag
- Consistent styling with existing community management pages
- Modal dialogs for delete confirmations
- Alert messages for success/error feedback
- Responsive datatable with sortable columns

#### Styling
Added to `/static/dashboard.css`:
- `.c-alert` component with success, danger, and info variants
- Utility classes: `.u-text-center`, `.u-text-right`, `.u-clamp-2`

### Navigation
Updated `/WEB-INF/tags/layouts/admin-dashboard.tag` to include:
- Students link at `/admin/students`
- Moderators link at `/admin/moderators`

## User Workflows

## Security Considerations
- Password hashing using BCrypt for new users
- Role-based access control (admin only)
- CSRF protection via POST requests for mutations
- SQL injection prevention via PreparedStatements

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk operations (select multiple users for deletion)
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- Advanced filters (by community, academic year, etc.)
- Pagination for large datasets
- User activity logs
- Email notifications for account creation
- Password reset functionality from admin panel

## Notes
- The old `/students` endpoints (using the `Student` model) remain for backward compatibility
- New implementation uses the `User` model with role-based filtering
- Community names are shown by ID; could be enhanced with JOIN to show actual names
- Delete operations cascade appropriately based on foreign key constraints
