# Resource Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the resource deletion feature that allows students to delete their own resources and subject coordinators to delete resources for subjects they manage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Student Resource Deletion

#### Modified: `DeleteResourceServlet.java` (Student)
- **Location:** `/src/main/java/com/uninest/controller/student/DeleteResourceServlet.java`
- **Changes:** 
  - Removed status restrictions on deletion
  - Students can now delete their own resources at any time regardless of status (pending, approved, rejected, pending_edit)
  - Maintains authorization check to ensure only resource owners can delete

#### Modified: `resources.jsp`
- **Location:** `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/student/resources.jsp`
- **Changes:**
  - Added delete button to My Resources table view

- **Changes:**
  - Removed status restrictions from delete button
  - Delete button now appears for all statuses when viewing own resource
  - Enhanced confirmation message

### 2. Subject Coordinator Resource Deletion

#### Created: `DeleteResourceServlet.java` (Coordinator)

- **URL Pattern:** `/subject-coordinator/resource-approvals/delete`
- **Features:**
  - Verifies user is a coordinator
  - Checks if user is coordinator for the resource's subject
  - Authorizes deletion only if user coordinates the subject
  - Permanently deletes resource from database

- **Location:** `/src/main/java/com/uninest/controller/student/StudentResourcesServlet.java`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `SubjectCoordinatorDAO` dependency
  - Checks if current user is coordinator for the subject being viewed
  - Passes `isCoordinatorForSubject` flag to JSP

#### Modified: `ResourceDetailServlet.java`
- **Location:** `/src/main/java/com/uninest/controller/student/ResourceDetailServlet.java`
- **Changes:**
  - Added coordinator authorization check
  - Coordinators can view any resource for subjects they manage
  - Passes `isCoordinatorForSubject` flag to JSP

#### Modified: `resources.jsp`
- **Changes:**
  - Added coordinator delete button on topic view (when user is coordinator but not owner)
  - Different form action for coordinator deletions

#### Modified: `resource-detail.jsp`
- **Changes:**
  - Added coordinator delete button (when user is coordinator but not owner)
  - Separate delete form for coordinators

### 3. Subject Coordinator Dashboard Enhancements

- **Changes:**
  - Changed default tab from "new" to "requests"
  - Added support for "approved" and "rejected" tabs
  - Routes to appropriate DAO method based on tab selection

#### Modified: `ResourceDAO.java`
- **Location:** `/src/main/java/com/uninest/model/dao/ResourceDAO.java`
- **New Methods:**
  - `findApprovedBySubjectIds(List<Integer> subjectIds)` - Fetches approved resources for coordinator's subjects
  - `findRejectedBySubjectIds(List<Integer> subjectIds)` - Fetches rejected resources for coordinator's subjects
  - Both methods order by approval_date DESC

#### Modified: `resource-approvals.jsp`
- **Location:** `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/subject-coordinator/resource-approvals.jsp`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated tabs: Requests, Approved, Rejected, Edit Approvals
  - Dynamic table columns based on active tab
  - Shows approval date and approver for approved/rejected resources
  - Shows upload date for pending resources

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Student Functionality
1. **My Resources Page:**
   - [ ] Login as a student
   - [ ] Navigate to My Resources
   - [ ] Verify delete button appears for all own resources
   - [ ] Click delete button
   - [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
   - [ ] Confirm deletion
   - [ ] Verify resource is deleted and success message appears
   - [ ] Test deletion for pending, approved, and rejected resources

2. **Topic-Specific Page:**
   - [ ] Navigate to a topic that has your resources
   - [ ] Verify delete button appears for your own resources
   - [ ] Test deletion from topic view
   - [ ] Verify resources from other users don't show delete button (unless you're coordinator)

3. **Resource Details Page:**
   - [ ] View one of your resources
   - [ ] Verify delete button appears
   - [ ] Test deletion from detail page
   - [ ] Verify redirect back to My Resources with success message

#### Coordinator Functionality
1. **Topic View (as Coordinator):**
   - [ ] Login as a user who is a subject coordinator
   - [ ] Navigate to a topic for a subject you coordinate
   - [ ] Verify delete button appears for resources you don't own
   - [ ] Test deleting another student's resource
   - [ ] Verify authorization and successful deletion

2. **Resource Details (as Coordinator):**
   - [ ] View a resource from a subject you coordinate
   - [ ] Verify you can access it even if not approved
   - [ ] Verify delete button appears if you're not the owner
   - [ ] Test deletion

3. **Resource Approvals Dashboard:**
   - [ ] Navigate to Subject Coordinator > Resource Approvals
   - [ ] Verify four tabs: Requests, Approved, Rejected, Edit Approvals
   - [ ] Test each tab displays correct resources
   - [ ] Verify Requests tab shows pending new uploads
   - [ ] Verify Approved tab shows approved resources with approval date
   - [ ] Verify Rejected tab shows rejected resources
   - [ ] Verify Edit Approvals tab shows pending edits
   - [ ] Test delete button on each tab
   - [ ] Verify approve/reject buttons only on Requests and Edit Approvals

#### Authorization Testing
1. **Unauthorized Access:**
   - [ ] Try to delete another student's resource (should fail)
   - [ ] Try to access coordinator delete endpoint as regular student (should fail)
   - [ ] Verify proper error messages

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] Test deletion with invalid resource ID
   - [ ] Test deletion of non-existent resource
   - [ ] Test deletion of resource from subject you don't coordinate

## Database Impact
- Resources are permanently deleted from the database
- No soft delete or archiving implemented
- Related foreign key constraints should handle cascading if configured

## Security Considerations
- Authorization checks at servlet level
- Ownership verification for student deletions
- Coordinator status verification for coordinator deletions
- Subject-level authorization for coordinators
- Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions

## UI/UX Enhancements
- Consistent delete button styling across all pages
- Clear confirmation messages before deletion
- Success/error feedback messages after operations
- Appropriate icons (trash-2 from Lucide)
- Disabled state not implemented (buttons are hidden when not authorized)

## Future Enhancements
- Add soft delete with ability to restore
- Add deletion history/audit log
- Add bulk delete functionality
- Add file cleanup when deleting resources with uploaded files
- Add notification to resource owner when coordinator deletes their resource
