# Moderator Approval Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the moderator approval workflow and signup form enhancements for the Uninest application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Moderator Approval Workflow
- **New Field**: Added `is_approved` boolean field to users table
- **Automatic Behavior**:
  - Students: Automatically approved on signup (can login immediately)
  - Moderators: Require admin approval before accessing the system
- **Login Prevention**: Unapproved moderators are blocked from logging in with a clear error message
- **Redirect Flow**: After signup, moderators are redirected to a waiting/pending approval page

### 2. Pending Approval Page
- **Location**: `/auth/pending-approval` or `/WEB-INF/views/auth/pending-approval.jsp`
- **Styling**: Matches the existing auth pages (inspired by forgot-password-requested.jsp)

  - Clock icon to indicate waiting state
  - Clear messaging about approval status
  - Link back to login page
  - Consistent footer with ToS and Privacy links

### 3. Enhanced Signup Form

- **Database**: Stored as integer (1-4) in `academic_year` column
- **Validation**: Required, must be between 1-4

#### University Selection
- **Type**: Select dropdown
- **Options**: 15 Sri Lankan universities (pre-populated)
- **Database**: Foreign key to `universities` table

## Technical Changes

### Database Schema
**File**: `src/main/resources/db/migration/db.sql`

1. **New Table**: `universities`
   - Stores list of Sri Lankan universities
   - Referenced by users table

2. **Updated Table**: `users`
   - `is_approved`: TINYINT(1), default 1
   - `academic_year`: INT, nullable
   - `university_id`: INT, foreign key to universities table

### Backend Changes

#### New Files
1. **UniversityDAO.java**: Data access object for universities
   - `findAll()`: Returns list of all universities for dropdown

2. **PendingApprovalServlet.java**: Serves the pending approval page
   - URL pattern: `/auth/pending-approval`

#### Modified Files
1. **User.java**: Added new fields and getters/setters
   - `isApproved`, `academicYear`, `universityId`, `universityName`

2. **UserDAO.java**: Updated to handle new fields
   - `create()`: Inserts new fields
   - `findByEmail()`: Retrieves new fields with JOIN on universities
   - `map()`: Maps result set including new fields

3. **SignUpServlet.java**: Enhanced signup logic
   - Loads universities in doGet() for form population
   - Validates academic year and university in doPost()
   - Sets `is_approved=false` for moderators
   - Sets `is_approved=true` for students
   - Redirects moderators to pending approval page
   - Redirects students to dashboard (auto-login)

4. **LoginServlet.java**: Added approval check
   - Checks if moderator is approved before allowing login
   - Shows error message for unapproved moderators

### Frontend Changes

#### Modified Files
1. **signup.jsp**: Updated signup form
   - Added academic year select dropdown
   - Added university select dropdown (populated from database)
   - Grid layout automatically adjusts for new fields
   - University field spans full width of form

#### New Files
1. **pending-approval.jsp**: Waiting page for moderators
   - Clock icon
   - Clear approval pending message
   - Email notification notice
   - Link back to login

## User Flow

### Student Signup Flow
1. User fills out signup form (name, email, password, academic year, university)
2. Selects "Student" role
3. Submits form
4. Account created with `is_approved=1`
5. Automatically logged in
6. Redirected to student dashboard

### Moderator Signup Flow
1. User fills out signup form (name, email, password, academic year, university)
2. Selects "Moderator" role
3. Submits form
4. Account created with `is_approved=0`
5. NOT logged in
6. Redirected to pending approval page
7. Waits for admin approval

### Moderator Login (Before Approval)
1. Moderator attempts to login
2. Credentials validated
3. System checks `is_approved` status
4. If `is_approved=0`, shows error: "Your moderator account is pending approval by an administrator"
5. Login blocked

### Moderator Login (After Approval)
1. Admin updates `is_approved=1` in database
2. Moderator attempts to login
3. Credentials validated
4. Approval check passes
5. Logged in successfully
6. Redirected to moderator dashboard

## Admin Responsibilities

### Approving Moderators
Admins need to manually approve moderators by updating the database:

```sql
-- View pending moderators
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.academic_year, un.name AS university, u.created_at
FROM users u
JOIN roles r ON u.role_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN universities un ON u.university_id = un.id
WHERE r.name = 'moderator' AND u.is_approved = 0
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;

-- Approve a specific moderator
UPDATE users 
SET is_approved = 1 
WHERE id = <user_id>;
```

### Future Enhancement Suggestion
Create an admin dashboard interface to:
- List all pending moderator accounts
- View moderator profile information (email, university, academic year)
- One-click approve/reject buttons
- Email notifications to users on approval/rejection
