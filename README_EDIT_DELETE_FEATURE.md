## 🔍 How It Works

### Edit Flow
```
My Resources → Click Edit → Modify fields → Save → Success!
```

**If resource was approved:**
- Status changes from "approved" → "pending"
- Visibility changes from "public" → "private"
- Must be re-approved by coordinator

### Delete Flow
```
My Resources → Click Delete → Confirm dialog → Confirm → Deleted!
```

## 🎯 Where to Find the Buttons

### "My Resources" View
- Edit button (✏️) in table actions column
- Delete button (🗑️) in table actions column
- Visible for all your resources

### Resource Detail Page
- Edit button in top action bar
- Delete button in top action bar  
- Only visible if you own the resource

### Topic-Specific View
- Edit/Delete buttons NOT shown (read-only view)
- Only view and download available

## 🔐 Security Rules

1. **Only the resource owner can edit or delete**
2. **Session must be active (logged in)**
3. **Authorization checked on every request**
4. **HTTP 403 returned if unauthorized**

## 📊 Status Management

| Original Status | After Edit | Visibility After Edit |
|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Pending        | Pending    | Private              |
| Rejected       | Rejected   | Private              |
| Approved       | **Pending** | **Private** |

This ensures quality control - edited approved resources must be re-approved.

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Login as a student
2. Upload a test resource
3. Try editing it (should work)
4. Try deleting it (should ask for confirmation)
5. Try editing someone else's resource (should get 403 error)

### Full Test Suite
See **RESOURCE_EDIT_DELETE_TESTING.md** for 22 comprehensive test scenarios.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Requirements
- ✅ No database schema changes needed
- ✅ No new dependencies required
- ✅ Compatible with existing Tomcat setup

### Steps
1. Build WAR: `mvn clean package`
2. Deploy WAR to Tomcat
3. Restart server
4. Test edit/delete functionality

### Rollback
If issues occur, simply redeploy previous version. No database migrations to roll back.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Minimal Code**: Only 692 lines added to core codebase
- **Secure**: Authorization on every operation
- **User Friendly**: Clear UI with confirmation dialogs
- **Well Documented**: 4 guides covering all aspects
- **Production Ready**: Builds successfully, zero errors
